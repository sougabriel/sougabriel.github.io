# IFMaker Web System

At the Maker Lab of the Farroupilha Federal Institute - SÃ£o Vicente do Sul Campus, the lack of a material and access control system has been causing difficulties in locating materials and the entry of unidentified persons. This work proposes the development of a web solution for stock management for the maker lab. 

The solution aims to manage material reservations, replacing the manual methods and online spreadsheets currently used, through the development of two applications. The theoretical framework addresses concepts of web applications such as Single-Page Applications (SPAs) and Application Programming Interface (API), in addition, similar stock control projects are discussed to support the development of the proposed applications.
