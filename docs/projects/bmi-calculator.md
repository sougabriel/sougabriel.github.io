# BMI Calculator

Using the AngularJs library to learn its base concepts for a future college project, I developed this Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.

The goal of this project is to study the basic concepts of AngularJs, with the rendering of dynamic data in HTML and the creation of an app. It is important to say that this project has a few lines of code in JavaScript, which shows how powerful AngularJs can be.
